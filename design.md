## Design
Every Object you interact with (Book, Movie, ect) inherits from the ApiMixin.
The goal of this SDK is to have a native feeling bi-directional SDK across the objects for simplicity

## Design inspiration
* I drew inspiration from SQLAlchemy (mixins)
* I tried to keep the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) tried and true
* I drew inspiration from KISS (Keep it simple stupid) from Arch striving towards a native-feeling simple SDK
* I drew inspiration from YAGNI (Ya ain't gonna need it) to ensure simplicity
